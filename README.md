My notes from following along with the lectures from the course 'PyTorch for Deep Learning Bootcamp' on Udemy.  The most significant model we learned how to train in the course is FoodVision Big, which classifies images of food.  You can try out my deployment of the model [here](https://reedhodges-pytorch-course-foodvision-big.hf.space).
